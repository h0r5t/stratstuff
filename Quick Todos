- Rotate some textures and change id system accordingly so ground and element textures look better
- Attach paths to each WorldPoint they cross so paths can be recalculated when a WP change event occurs 
  (only when WP goes from !collides to collides)
- Make Task Management so Frontend can create/register own tasks
- Make task list "impossibleTasks" in TaskManager, these will be eventually moved to openTasks e.g. when they can be reached

++++  Frontend  ++++
- Load world, elements, objects:
      values = [[0 for x in range(300)] for x in range(300)] 
      for o in range(0,300):
        for i in range(0, 300):
            values[i][o] = i+o
- Ensure working event system --> use registerEvent in IDynamicScript!!!!!
- Remove script on errors in it and inform the user/player about it (future: pause game etc.)
