- Set up git so libs get uplodaded?! or maven...
- Rotate some textures and change id system accordingly so ground and element textures look better
- Attach paths to each WorldPoint they cross so paths can be recalculated when a WP change event occurs 
  (only when WP goes from !collides to collides)
- Make Task Management "convenient" and modular
  --> make abstract class ComplexTask that contains multiple simple tasks
  --> tasks should have the method isFinished
- Make task list "impossibleTasks" in TaskManager, these will be eventually moved to openTasks e.g. when they can be reached
